            Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It
            contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other
            interface components.Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework
            to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development,
            which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden.
