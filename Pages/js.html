        JavaScript is a client-side scripting language of web developed by
        Netscape in 1995 with the name LiveScript. JavaScript is used to build
        interactive websites with dynamic features and to validate form data.
        JavaScript is high-level, dynamic and browser interpreted programming
        language, supported by all modern web browsers. Apart from web browser,
        JavaScript is also used to build scalable web applications using Node
        JS. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile
        application development. JavaScript is also known as the Programming
        Language of web as it is the only programming language for Web browsers.
        JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight
        and cross-platform. The programs in this language are called scripts.
        They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as
        the page loads. Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They
        don’t need special preparation or compilation to run. The browser has an
        embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.
